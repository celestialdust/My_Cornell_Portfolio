# Cornell Machine Learning Program Portfolio

This repository showcases my machine learning coursework and capstone project completed as part of **Cornell University's Machine Learning Certificate Program**. The projects demonstrate proficiency in various ML techniques, from traditional algorithms to deep learning approaches.

## üéØ Capstone Project: Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews

**File**: `DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb`

### Project Overview
Built an end-to-end machine learning solution to classify book reviews as positive or negative using natural language processing and neural networks.

### Key Achievements
- **Problem Definition**: Formulated a binary classification problem with clear business value for e-commerce platforms
- **Data Analysis**: Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis on 1,973 book reviews
- **Feature Engineering**: Implemented TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features (18,558 vocabulary size)
- **Model Architecture**: Designed and trained a neural network with:
  - 3 hidden layers (64, 32, 16 neurons)
  - Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
  - SGD optimizer with binary crossentropy loss
- **Model Performance**: Achieved convergence over 50 epochs with proper validation monitoring
- **Evaluation**: Included comprehensive model evaluation with loss/accuracy visualization

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Model Architecture
nn_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.1),
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.1),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

### Business Impact
This model could help:
- **E-commerce platforms** automatically moderate reviews
- **Publishers** understand reader sentiment at scale  
- **Recommendation systems** improve book suggestions based on review quality
